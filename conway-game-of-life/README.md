### Conway's Game of Life Rules

1. **Underpopulation**: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.

2. **Survival**: Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

3. **Overpopulation**: Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
