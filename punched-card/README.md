# What is punched card?

**A punched card** (or punch card) is a piece of stiff paper that contains digital information
represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions. Punched cards were
used as a data storage medium in the early days of computing and for various automated
processing tasks.

For encoding I used alphabet from ./resource/alphabet.jpg file as an example. The final alphabet
you can see in ./resource/alphabet.txt file.
