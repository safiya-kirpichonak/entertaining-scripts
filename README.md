# Useless scripts [In progress]

This repository contains useless scripts that I have written. They are not big enough to be a 
separate repository, but they were fun to write and I learned something new while writing them.

## List of scripts

- conway-game-of-life - A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.
- punched-card - A simple implementation creator and decoder of punched card.

## Plan

- steganography - A simple implementation of steganography in Python.
