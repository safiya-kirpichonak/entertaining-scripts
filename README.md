# Entertaining scripts [In progress]

This repository contains entertaining scripts that I have written. They are not big enough to be a 
separate repository, but they were fun to write and I learned something new while writing them.

## Installation

clone this project:

```
git clone git@github.com:trudy418/entertaining-scripts.git
```

## List of scripts

- conway-game-of-life - A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.
- punched-card - A simple implementation creator and decoder of punched card in Python.

## Plan

- smart-games - Create a collection of smart games.
- steganography - A simple implementation of steganography in Python.
