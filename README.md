# Entertaining scripts [In progress]

This repository contains entertaining scripts that I have written. They are not big enough to be a 
separate repository, but they were fun to write and I learned something new while writing them.

## Installation

```
git@github.com:safiya-kirpichonak/entertaining-scripts.git
