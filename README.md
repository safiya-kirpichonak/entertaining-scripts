# Entertaining scripts [In progress]

This repository contains entertaining scripts Iâ€™ve written. They aren't large enough to warrant a separate repository, 
but they were fun to create, and I learned something new while doing so.

## List of scripts

- conway-game-of-life - A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.
- punched-card - A simple implementation creator and decoder of punched card in Python.

## Plan

- smart-games - Create a collection of smart games.
- steganography - A simple implementation of steganography in Python.
- weird-translator - Create translator from unknown language.
